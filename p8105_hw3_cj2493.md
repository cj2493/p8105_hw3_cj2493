Problem 1
---------

Load BRFSS data from the p8105.datasets package and clean:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010) 
brfss_smart2010 = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, labels = c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Some problem solving using the data:

``` r
brfss_2002 = filter(brfss_smart2010, year == 2002) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  count(locationabbr) %>%
  filter(n == 7) %>%
  mutate(state = abbr2state(locationabbr)) %>%
  select(-locationabbr)
```

In 2002, the states that had 7 locations represented were the following: Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina.

Make a "spaghetti plot" that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010:

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of "Excellent" responses across locations in NY state.

``` r
brfss_table_data = filter(brfss_smart2010, year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(data_value),
         sd_excellent = sd(data_value)) %>%
  knitr::kable()

brfss_table_data
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
|  2002|         24.04000|       4.486424|
|  2006|         22.53333|       4.000833|
|  2010|         22.70000|       3.567212|
