Problem 1
---------

Load BRFSS data from the p8105.datasets package and clean:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010) 
brfss_smart2010 = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, labels = c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Some problem solving using the data:

``` r
brfss_2002 = filter(brfss_smart2010, year == 2002) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  count(locationabbr) %>%
  filter(n == 7) %>%
  mutate(state = abbr2state(locationabbr)) %>%
  select(-locationabbr)
```

In 2002, the states that had 7 locations represented were the following: Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina.
